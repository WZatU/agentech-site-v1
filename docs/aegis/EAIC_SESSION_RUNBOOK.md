# AEGIS EAIC qualification and evidence runbook

This is the complete source-to-result procedure for AEGIS `192.168.4.88`.
Customer Python never goes to the robot. The Gateway translator accepts only
literal supported calls, produces a reviewed JSON plan, hashes it, and stages
that inert plan plus trusted runner modules.

## 1. Pin and verify both repositories

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/agent-tech0316/agentech_sdk.git
git clone https://github.com/agent-tech0316/agentech-site-v1.git

cd agentech_sdk
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
python -m pip install -e ".[aegis]"
$sdkCommit = git rev-parse HEAD
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

cd ..\agentech-site-v1
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
npm ci
$gatewayCommit = git rev-parse HEAD
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Every command must exit `0`. This is an offline gate, not physical evidence.
Record both commits, package versions, FF build, review ID, submission ID,
session ID, correlation ID, AEGIS D1 model, and UTC/Pacific timestamps.

## 2. Compile tomorrow's canonical source offline

```powershell
$source = 'docs/aegis/examples/aegis-29-command-qualification.py'
$plan = '.robot-stream-runtime/offline-aegis-29.plan.json'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force '.robot-stream-runtime' | Out-Null
python scripts/compile-robot-plan.py $source OFFLINE-REVIEW-ID $plan
python -c "import json; p=json.load(open(r'$plan')); print({'version':p['version'],'model':p['robot_model'],'commands':len(p['commands']),'source_sha256':p['source_sha256'],'profile':p['device_profile']})"
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $source
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $plan
```

Expected output:

- plan version `2`, model `aegis`, exactly `29` literal calls;
- device `192.168.4.88`;
- `battery_present=true`, source `ecal:battery_state.power`;
- source hash matches and customer source text is absent from the plan;
- turn pair is `+90/-90` at positive `60 deg/s` magnitude;
- yaw/pitch/roll pair is `+0.25/-0.25 rad` at `0.30 rad/s`.

The translator rejects variables, loops, expressions, unknown names/keywords,
nonfinite or out-of-range values, invalid resolved diagonals, and conflicting
turn forms. The trusted runner validates the whole plan again before dispatch.

## 3. Physical preflight

Stop unless every item is true:

- booked session and explicit operator authorization;
- flat nonslip marked 2 m by 2 m area, robot near center;
- OBS and Camo/external camera show changing frames and the complete boundary;
- no duplicate OBS or Gateway bridge process;
- handheld controller and separate emergency path ready;
- no other client owns motion;
- SDK/Gateway commits match the reviewed versions;
- Gateway clock shows correct UTC and Pacific conversion.

Velocity/time profiles are open-loop; they do not promise exact distance.
Watch the physical boundary and stop if acceleration, braking or traction makes
travel larger than expected.

## 4. Tomorrow's ordinary 29-call sequence

Use [`aegis-29-command-qualification.py`](examples/aegis-29-command-qualification.py)
without editing it after review. It stands once, qualifies squat, returns to
stand once, performs paired translations, low-gait pairs, `+90/-90` turns,
bounded visible attitude pairs, stay, integer battery percentage and final sit.

Ordinary actions do not repeatedly call stand. The robot stays upright between
standing actions. Squat uses `dog_task`'s localhost command channel without
replacing `/dev/input/js0` or restarting `dog_task`; success requires unchanged
physical-controller ownership.

Jump, backflip, stop and emergency stop are separate supervised recordings:

- jump/backflip need full landing clearance and individual video;
- stop must zero velocity while preserving supported posture/controller;
- emergency stop must send command `90` once, immediately enter DAMPING and
  latch SDK motion until a successful stand recovery.

Do not express “stop during motion” as two sequential customer calls: the first
motion call is synchronous and would finish first. Use a separate trusted
operator safety channel for the interruption capture.

## 5. Gateway and OBS operation

During the authorized window, run the deployed bridge normally. For a bridge
repair use:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/restart-robot-stream-gateway.ps1
```

That script restarts only the exact Gateway bridge process. It never restarts
Windows, the robot, OBS or Camo. The watchdog retains one bridge and one OBS
process; duplicate OBS fails closed instead of competing for the camera. The
default bridge poll is `1000 ms` and may be configured down to `500 ms` without
creating duplicate capture owners.

## 6. Expected trusted result

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "outcome": "completed",
  "command_count": 29,
  "completed_count": 29,
  "error": null
}
```

The result must include matching IDs, hashes, timestamps, device profile,
Diary path and 29 contiguous records. The runner intentionally stops at the
first exception, preserves it, attempts a normal stop, omits later commands,
and persists `failed`. It must never mark Hub complete from compilation alone.

## 7. Evidence index

For each action retain the exact command/parameters, UTC/Pacific time, model,
structured `status/result/error/logs`, Diary/raw log, readable screenshot and
external video. For the chain retain review PASS, schedule, Gateway claim,
runner start/result, capture return, and Hub `Completed`/Gateway `finished`
using one ID tuple.

| Delivery item | Conclusion | Evidence | Time | IDs | Versions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDK/L0.5 action | PENDING_LIVE | per-action log/JSON/screenshot/video/Diary | TBD | submission/session/correlation | SDK/Gateway commits |
| EAIC Hub chain | NOT_COVERED until captured | review/schedule/claim/result/Hub/Gateway | TBD | same tuple | Gateway commit |
| Device model/adapter/wrapper | PENDING_LIVE | connection/state/error/recovery logs + video | TBD | same tuple | SDK commit |
| Primary 17 rows | PENDING_LIVE | direct links for every conclusion | TBD | same tuple | both commits |

Registration, heartbeat, lease, `last_seen` and reconnect remain `NOT_COVERED`
unless actual platform evidence is attached.

## 8. Session 38 root cause and repairs

Session 38 proved review, scheduling, compilation, delivery and Diary logging.
It failed because `stand()` returned before authoritative state stabilized;
`squat()` then began during the transition, chose the wrong controller state
and timed out waiting for `18/17`. The fail-fast runner correctly omitted later
commands, so that session did not test forward/backward.

The repairs wait for stable stand/squat state, perform only bounded owned-route
recovery, restore the physical controller, validate resolved profiles, use the
working robot-side heading route, separate normal stop from DAMPING, issue only
one emergency command, read real eCAL battery percentage, and make the trusted
runner result authoritative for Hub status. Earlier `0.20 m/s` translation was
also too small to be visually diagnostic after acceleration; tomorrow uses the
live-visible paired values while external video enforces containment.

## 9. Session 43 focused squat rerun

Use [`aegis-session-43-squat-qualification.py`](examples/aegis-session-43-squat-qualification.py)
without retyping it. It compiles to nine calls. `emergency_stop()` is terminal,
so the runner records `cleanup_skipped` instead of sending a duplicate stop.

Session 43 submission `agentech-20260825233939-p16kmc` compiled correctly and
completed `stand()`, but `squat()` ended at public state `51/999`. The failure
was in the SDK Adapter, not the translator: after stand, public state was
`18/1` while `dog_task`'s private action cache was stale, so action `106`
selected its `51/0` fallback. The repaired SDK sends native no-motion action
`138` once to synchronize that cache, then action `106` once to enter `18/17`.

The rerun passes only with stable and retained `18/17`, unchanged controller
owner PID, `dog_task_restarted=false`, completed squat movements, one final
e-stop, a complete Diary/result, and synchronized video. The original Session
43 remains failure evidence and must not be relabeled PASS.
